# Newsletter Form - How It Works

The newsletter form is now **fully functional** and requires **zero setup**! It uses FormSubmit.co, a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

## ✅ Already Configured

The form is already set up to send emails to: **hello@eunoialabs.io**

No API keys, no configuration needed - it just works!

## First Submission Verification

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The first time someone submits the form, FormSubmit will send a **verification email** to hello@eunoialabs.io.

**You must click the verification link in that email to activate the form.**

After verification, all future submissions will go straight to your inbox.

## How It Works

1. User enters their email and clicks "Join Waitlist"
2. Form submits to FormSubmit.co API
3. FormSubmit forwards the email to hello@eunoialabs.io
4. You receive an email with:
   - Subject: "New Galinia Waitlist Signup"
   - The user's email address
   - Clean table format

## Features

✅ **100% Free** - No limits, no credit card  
✅ **Zero Setup** - Works immediately  
✅ **Spam Protection** - Built-in bot detection  
✅ **Static Site** - No backend required  
✅ **AJAX Submission** - No page reload

## Testing

1. Go to your website
2. Scroll to the newsletter section
3. Enter a test email (e.g., test@example.com)
4. Click "Join Waitlist"
5. Check hello@eunoialabs.io inbox
6. **Click the verification link** (first time only)
7. Done! All future submissions will arrive instantly

## Email Format

You'll receive emails like this:

**Subject**: New Galinia Waitlist Signup

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | user@example.com |

## No Setup Required!

Unlike Web3Forms which required an access key, FormSubmit works out of the box. The form is already configured and ready to use.

Just make sure to verify the first submission when it arrives!
